# Remaster log

One entry per remaster pass (see the dispatcher's remaster loop). Newest last.
Each entry: date, job, pass, the three gaps seen, what changed, PNG paths, what is still weak.

## 2026-10-05, Job 1 (mechanics lab), look before pass 1 (Claude, Opus)
Rendered with `tests/mechanics_lab_capture.tscn`, PNGs in `P:/GameDev/Temp/mechanics_lab/`.
- Works: all five stations load; the tank breaks and pools (16 pools); rain, wind, etch and the covered/open acid test run; ground holes and broken crates show.
- Weak: the liquid is a flat red decal plus loose red beads, not liquid (no surface, no flow, no splash; SPLASHES 0); no visible glass tank after the break; the weather shot reads as white streaks on a dark box; the yard is an untextured brown tray; placeholder text HUD in the corner; the held weapon is not visible; the melee is a camera ray, not the moveset (job 3 replaces it).
